Cheerlights code for arduino

Thanks to the original authors who made the code , i will give credits now it works .

Here's why i did it .

The project using a arduino and a ethernet shield had fantastic fades , but the ethernet sheild was twitchy and crashed without
any provocation .

The project that uses a Raspberry pi, Arduino and a tlc5940 was super stable, but just wasnt what i wanted as the tlc5940
could only drive led's and i wanted a 5m colour ribbon.

So i spliced the 2 stable bits together and "it works"
